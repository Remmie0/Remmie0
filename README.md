- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Remmie0
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a data enthusiast. I focus on data science, specializing in LLMs combined with NLP, deep and reinforcement learning, cloud computing, and recommendation systems.
- ðŸŒ± I'm studying Computer Science: Data Science at Leiden University --> Master Thesis focusing on 'Automating Data Science by harnessing the power of Large Language Models'
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: remcostuij@gmail.com

I completed the Systems Engineering, Policy, and Management bachelor's at the TU Delft. 
I am currently working as a data engineer/analyst in a combination role, where I develop and maintain a SQL Server data warehouse and the flows in and out of the DWH.

Note: Unfortunately due to University Policy I can not make many of my repo's public due to leakage to other students in current or following years, and is my Thesis Research still a work in progress and therefor protected.
